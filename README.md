# PomodoroTimer

Hi there, this is Yash here. I built this app as a part of my job application at Toggl.

Built using: Swift and SwiftUI
Architecture: MVVM

About:
The app has 2 modes: Focus and Break. The duration of each mode can be changed based on the user's need. The app has a flip clock animation similar to
Toggl Track's iOS app.

Features:
1. Control app from menu bar directly
2. User notification on completing sessions
3. Focus session is followed by a break session by default


You can find the app on TestFlight here: https://testflight.apple.com/join/9GnEvOr6
